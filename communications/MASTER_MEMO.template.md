## Project Overview
[2-3 paragraphs describing what we're building and why]

## Architecture Decisions
[Key technical decisions that ALL implementors must follow]

## Phase Overview

## Phase 1: [Name]

### Scope
- [Specific deliverable 1]
- [Specific deliverable 2]

### Files to Create/Modify
- `path/to/file.py` - [what to do]

### Interface Contract
- Exports: [what this phase provides to others]
- Expects: [what this phase needs from others - should be minimal for parallelism]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]

## Integration Points
[How phases connect - the reconciler uses this to wire things up]

## Out of Scope
[Explicitly list what we're NOT doing to prevent scope creep]
